      "Candidate Analysis (Todd Sullivan):\n",
      "Strengths:\n",
      "- Extensive IT experience (2001-2012+, over 10 years)\n",
      "- Project management experience with large budgets ($25M, $19M projects)\n",
      "- Experience with complex systems, networks, telecommunications\n",
      "- Led teams (5-person Integrated Product Team)\n",
      "- Bachelor's in Information Technology (3.67 GPA)\n",
      "- Multiple degrees with high GPAs\n",
      "- Experience with system integration, testing, documentation\n",
      "- Government/military IT experience with security clearances likely\n",
      "\n",
      "Meta Culture Fit Assessment:\n",
      "- \"Move fast\" - Military/government experience may be more bureaucratic\n",
      "- \"Build awesome things\" - Has worked on large infrastructure projects\n",
      "- \"Be direct and respect colleagues\" - Military background could align\n",
      "- \"Focus on long-term impact\" - Has experience with major infrastructure projects\n",
      "- \"Collaborative innovators\" - Led teams and worked with stakeholders\n",
      "- \"Original thinkers\" - Hard to assess from resume, mostly traditional IT roles\n",
      "- \"Thoughtful risk-takers\" - Government work is typically risk-averse\n",
      "\n",
      "Concerns:\n",
      "- All experience is government/military sector, which has different pace/culture than tech\n",
      "- No commercial tech company experience\n",
      "- Resume format and writing style seems outdated\n",
      "- No mention of modern tech stack, cloud, agile methodologies\n",
      "- Last experience listed is 2012 - there appears to be a gap or the resume is outdated\n",
      "- May not fit the \"move fast\" culture coming from government work\n",
      "\n",
      "For a \"highly competitive\" position at Meta with 200+ applications for 20 interview slots, this candidate would likely not make the cut. While experienced, the background doesn't align well with Meta's fast-paced tech culture and modern IT practices.\n",
